## How to Play

In your battle with the dragon, there are **three** actions you can take:

1. Launch an Attack
2. Launch a Strong Attack
3. Heal yourself

These actions are activated by clicking on their respective buttons.

Note: You cannot heal over your Max Health Points, which is decided by the player at the start of the game. If invalid input or no input is detected when asked, the default Max Health Points value is set to 100.

The dragon hits harder than the player. Both the dragon and the player have the same amount of Health Points.

## Installation

None needed! You can run this straight in the browser!
